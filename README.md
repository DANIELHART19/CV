# Daniel Hart
I'm a developer, with a background in the health and fitness.

I enjoy building digital products that look great, function smoothly and feel great to use that solve problems or entertain people. Preferrably in Javascript.

I'm self driven, hard working and easy going. 

## Experience:
### Founders & Coders (2015)
In early 2015 I enrolled as a student at Founders & Coders in London. F&C is a 3 month intensive coding course with a focus on Javascript and Node JS. After graduation, I've worked with commercial clients, mostly building MVP's for startups.

### Propell (2012 - 2014)
After finishing my studies I founded a kids app startup named Propell, which I ran for 2.5 years as the CEO. Propell's childrens books, educational material and music apps have been downloaded over 1 million times by parents around the world. My responsibilities included management, marketing & PR, administration, accounting and everything else related to running a startup.

### Mikrojobb (2011)
While studying, I founded a Norwegian site to buy and sell micro services. Mikrojobb quickly grew to be the most popular of its kind in Norway and was aquired by NeedBox.com in 2013.
